This repository contains our codes for the project "Adversarial attacks/learning" , our final presentation as well as our report . In more details :

* cifar10.ipynb contains our code on how we trained a normal classifier on CIFAR10 dataset
* adversarial_utils.py contains functions used in cifar10.ipynb and cifar10_noteboook.ipynb
* cifar10.h5 contains a saved model trained in cifar10.ipynb
* cifar10_noteboook.ipynb contains our code on adversarial attacks, adversarial learning and ensemble adversarial learning. It also contains different experiments done in our project
* fgsm_adversarial_weights.h5 contains saved weights of a model trained with adversarial FGSM
* pgd_adversarial_weights.h5 contains saved weights of our first model trained with adversarial PGD
* adversarial_weights_ensemble*.h5 contains saved weights of models trained with adversarial PGD
* normal_weights_ensemble*.h5 contains saved weights of models trained with a normal training
* presentation_Adversarial.pptx is our final presentation
* rapport_Adversarial.pdf is our report
